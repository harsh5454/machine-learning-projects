### 1. Face Clustering using KMeans
📂 `face_clustering/`  
Clusters human faces from input images using OpenCV and unsupervised learning.

### 2. Stock Price Prediction
📂 `stock_price_prediction/`  
Predicts next-day stock prices using regression models and historical data.

### 3. OCR - Text Recognition
📂 `ocr_text_recognition/`  
Extracts text from scanned images using Tesseract OCR and image preprocessing techniques.
